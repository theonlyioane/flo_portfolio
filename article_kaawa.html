        <h5>CONCEPT</h5>
        <p>Different tones of lighting will give the piece of art life and beauty. While neutral wall tones will act as a blank canvas to the artistic mediums. The different stones used will provide different textures to the walls. The floors will be of warm dark and light earth tones not taking away from the beauty of the art. There will be large floor to ceiling windows to provide lots of natural light with UV protection from the sun. Showcasing a large floor to ceiling brick and glass wine cellar to entertain their guest. Giving the individual a feeling as if they are in a personal and private art gallery nestled in the Florida Keys.</p>

        <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
        <p>The Kaawas are an artistic couple who love wine and art. They are moving from Hawaii, and also have great love for food. Mrs. Kaawa is a painter and Mr. Kaawa is a Creative Director for one of the Top Businesses in the Graphic Design Industry. Therefore, he is able to work remote and will need to have a space for him to work and do a teleconference. They have asked Flormina Designs to design their brand new home in Key Largo, Florida. They want their home to be warm and inviting just like their hearts.</p>
